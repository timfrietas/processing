This is the intital comit on a traditional "tumbling blocks" Amish quilt pattern.

The code needs bit of work: optimaization for drawing rows and the replacement of some magic mumbers with some actual trig calculations so that it works with any intial cube size.

The next commit is likely to focus on dynamic or stochastic colors as well as hopefully addressing some of the above.
