This is the first take of hopefully many on Amish quilt patterns.

This one is specifically a take on an non-traditional approach to the tumbling blocks pattern in the style of a modern quilt maker I can't seem to find anymore.  What was interesting was that it was less about individual block patterns and more about columns of blocks.

At the time of this writing I want to immediately refactor the whole thing to get more flexibility and something more accurate to the original inspiration (see source comments), but it would take longer than I would like and I have other ideas I'd like to move on to.

Hopefully there will be a much more elegant and less garish tumbling_blocks_2 in the near future.
